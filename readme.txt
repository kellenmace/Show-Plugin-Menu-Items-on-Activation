Identify any newly added menu items on plugin activation.

== Description ==
Have you ever activated a WordPress plugin, then had to hunt around the admin sidebar trying to find the new menu items the plugin added? Or maybe after looking for them, you found out that the new plugin didn\'t even add any menu items at all. This plugin solves that problem by pointing out exactly which new menu items have been added to the admin sidebar every time a plugin is activated.

* If 1, 2 or 3 menu items were added, admin pointers will be displayed to point out the newly added menu items.
* If 4 or more menu items were added a \"Many new plugin menu items were added.\" notice will be displayed at the top of the screen.
* If no new menu items were added, a \"No new plugin menu items were added.\" notice will be displayed at the top of the screen.
